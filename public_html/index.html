<p>Non-human warfare is no longer a thing of the future.  Already hundreds of military personnel are controlling drones from the U.S. and surveying and attacking 
targets elsewhere.  To some this is a positive, in fact, it saves lives.  However, only U.S. lives are saved.  As with any war to date, taking lives is the name 
of the game.  With drone warfare, death and destruction are at the push of a button.  Although the drones are being controlled from the US, or naval ships around 
the world, the tragedies don't end on the battlefield.  There is a psychological aspect of the controller to consider as well.</p>

<a name="Who is in Control"><h3>Who is in Control</h3></a>
<p>The pilots of the drones we hear about are young men and women in the Air Force.  They pilot the drones from several Air Force bases in the US.  These are 
located in a few states, including Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico.</p>
<p>The United States Air Force drone program has been growing quickly.  In fact, the program has more than 1,300 employed as of this year, with plans to add 350 
more pilots by 2017.  Unfortunately for the USAF, the program has been growing too quickly.  The demand for new pilots is greater than those signing up.</p>
<p>Lack of interest in the drone program is due to several concerns about the job.  This is largely because new cadets entering the Air Force see it as a dead end 
career.  In fact, drone pilots have been shown to rank up more slowly than other Air Force specialists.  Another problem is that there is the perception that 
drone pilots are not real soldiers, and just play a more real "video game" for a living.</p>

<a name="How"><h3>How</h3></a>
<p>Large military drones are piloted from control rooms inside the U.S.  They have been described as "8x20 trailers... about the size of a formula one car."  the untrained eye, the controls look similar to the inside of any 
other cockpit.  However, instead of a window to the outside, the pilots have multiple monitors.  On these monitors the pilots can see all around them, with the 
ability to use zoom optics, infrared, thermal imaging, and more.</p>
<p>Many have described piloting a drone to be like playing a video game, and this is what it looks like.  In fact, the Air Force has considered making it more 
like a video game, using PlayStation or Wii controllers to pilot the plane.  This would be to attract more prospective pilots and make the job less tedious.</p>
<p>When on the job, pilots are in charge of scanning important locations for notable activity.  Once something is found, the pilot is praised.  Pilots use their 
specialized cameras to comb the landscapes.  Once targets are found, and pilots are given permission to fire, they will guide their missiles to the target.</p>
<p>One common drone used today is the Predator unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).  This particular plane can fly as low as 10,000 feet and be completely undetected by 
people on the ground.  Made out of extremely lightweight materials, it has a length of 27 feet, a height of 6.9 feet, and a wingspan of 48.7 feet.  The plane can 
reach speeds of up to 135 mph and altitudes of 25,000 feet.</p>

<a name="A History"><h3>A History</h3></a>
<p>The idea of a combat drone has been around since at least 1940.  In this year, the idea was published in an article in Popular Mechanics.  The authors were Dr. 
Lee De Forest, a radio device inventor, and U. A. Sanabra, a TV engineer.  However, the modern conception of a drone was conceived by John Stuart Foster Jr., the 
former head of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and nuclear physicist.</p>
